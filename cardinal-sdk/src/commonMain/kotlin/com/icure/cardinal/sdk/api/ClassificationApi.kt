	 * - The other participant of the delegation is the current data owner
	 * - The SDK is using hierarchical data owners and the other participant of the delegation is a parent of the

	 * - There is de-anonymization metadata for the delegation shared with the current data owner.

	 *
	 * At the same time since the de-anonymization metadata applies to a specific delegation and therefore to a specific
