	 *   the last version of the `from` patient: any changes to its content and/or metadata compared to what is actually stored in the database will be
	 *   ignored.
	 * - The metadata of the `into` patient will be automatically updated to contain also the metadata of the `from` patient and to keep track of the
	 *   merge:
	 *   - the `mergedIds` will be updated to contain the `from` patient id
	 *   - all secret ids of the `from` patient will be added to the `into` patient
	 *   - all data owners (including anonymous data owners) with access to the `from` patient will have the same access to the merged `into` patient
	 *     (unless they already had greater access to the `into` patient, in which case they keep the greater access)
	 * - The content of the `into` patient will be updated to match the content (name, address, note, ...) of the provided [mergedInto] parameter.
	 *   Note that since the metadata is automatically updated by this method you must not change the metadata of the `mergedInto` patient
	 *   (`delegations`, mergedInto`, ...): if there is any change between the metadata of the provided `mergedInto` patient and the stored patient this
	 *   method will fail.
	 *
	 * In case the revisions of [from] and/or [mergedInto] does not match the latest revisions for these patients in the database this
	 * method will fail without soft-deleting the `from` patient and without updating the `into` patient with the merged content and metadata. You will
	 * have to retrieve the updated versions of both patients before retrying the merge.
	 *
	 * Finally, note that this method only merges existing data, and does not perform any automatic sharing of the data. The secret ids and encryption
	 * keys will not be shared with users that had access only to one of the entity, you will have to use a share method after the merge
	 * if you want to do so.
	 * For example consider hcps A, B with access to P' and hcps A, C with access to P'', and we merge P'' into P'. After the merge:
	 * - A has access to all secret ids of the merged patient and to the encryption key of the merged patient
	 * - B has access to the encryption key of the merged patient (since it is the same as in P'), but only to the secret id which was originally from
	 *   the unmerged P'
	 * - C has no access to the encryption key of the merged patient, and has access only to the secret id which was originally from the unmerged P''
	 *
	 * Note that the user performing this operation must have write access to both patients.
	 *
	 * @param from the original, unmodified `from` patient. Its content will be unchanged and its metadata will be automatically updated by this method
	 * to reflect the merge.
	 * @param mergedInto the `into` patient with updated content result of the merge with the `from` patient, as specified by your application logic.
