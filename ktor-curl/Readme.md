The code in this module (`ktor-curl`) is taken as is from the original ktor repository, with little to no modification 
by iCure and it is therefore governed by the original license, included in the `LICENSE` file.

This is a temporary measure to allow for usage of websockets on linux platforms until the following issue is
resolved https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/KTOR-5199/Support-WebSockets-in-Curl-engine

The code is taken from release 3.0.0-beta-1 + the changes from https://github.com/ktorio/ktor/pull/3950.
