   *
   * Another advantage of using this authentication option over others is that in case all the cached tokens and secrets were to expire while
   * performing a request, instead of having the request fail the SDK will ask for a new secret from the [SmartAuthProvider] and the request will
   * automatically be retried with the new secret.

   *
   * The method will be provided with an array of the secrets types that are acceptable {@link acceptedSecrets}. Usually this array will contain multiple
   * elements, but this depends on the group configuration, the user (if he has 2fa setup or not), or the operation being performed. For groups using
   * default configurations and for patients without 2fa enabled for example the array will always contain the {@link AuthenticationClass.Password} element.
   * Usually the array contain also the {@link AuthenticationClass.LongLivedToken} element, but if the user is attempting to perform a sensitive operations
   * such as changing his password the default group configuration does not allow for the user to authenticate using a JWT obtained from a long-lived
   * token for this operation, meaning the array will not contain the {@link AuthenticationClass.LongLivedToken} element.
   *
   * Regardless of the number of elements in the array only one secret of the accepted types is sufficient for the operation to succeed.
   *
   * ## {@link AuthenticationClass.TwoFactorAuthentication} secret type
   *
   * The {@link AuthenticationClass.TwoFactorAuthentication} secret type is only used when the user has 2fa enabled. In this case the SDK will call
   * this method twice, once containing the {@link AuthenticationClass.Password} element in the {@link acceptedSecrets} array, and if the provided secret is a
   * valid password the SDK will immediately call this method again, this time containing the {@link AuthenticationClass.TwoFactorAuthentication}
   * instead of the {@link AuthenticationClass.Password} element.
   *
   * Any future call to this method from the same provider instance will not contain the {@link AuthenticationClass.Password} element anymore, as it is
   * cached, but it may contain the {@link AuthenticationClass.TwoFactorAuthentication} element instead.
   *
   * Note that the 2fa token is not needed for logging in through a long-lived or short-lived token, it is only used in combination with a password.
   * If the user is using 2fa, and you get in input as {@link acceptedSecrets} an array `[PASSWORD, LONG_LIVED_TOKEN, SHORT_LIVED_TOKEN]`, and you pass to
   * authenticate a long-lived token, the SDK will not call this method again to ask for the 2fa token.
   *
   * @param acceptedSecrets the types of secrets that are acceptable for the operation being performed.
   * @param previousAttempts the secrets that were previously attempted by the SDK for this operation. This array will be empty the first time this
   * method is called for a given operation, but it may contain multiple elements if the SDK has already called this method multiple times because the
   * previously returned secrets were not valid. The first element is the first secret that was attempted, and the last element is the most recently
   * attempted.
   * @param authProcessApi an api which can be used to request sms or email short-lived tokens for the user.
   * @return a promise that resolves with the secret and the secret type to use for authentication. If the promise rejects then the ongoing SDK
   * operation will fail without being re-attempted.
